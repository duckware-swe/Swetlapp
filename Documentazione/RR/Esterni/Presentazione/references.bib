	andwidth efﬁciency is a key objective in the design of a digital communication
	system. Traditionally it is accomplished by increasing the constellation
	size of the signaling system. In this thesis alternative techniques
	
	are studied. Because the communication channel is continuous, so must
	
	the actual time signals be. Therefore the construction of the continuous
	signals is included in the code design. Bandwidth efﬁciency is here
	obtained
	
	by two different signal generation forms: partial response signaling
	(PRS)
	
	and faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling. Common for the two techniques
	
	is that both obtain bandwidth efﬁciency by introducing a certain amount
	of
	
	intentional intersymbol interference (ISI).
	
	PRS is a coded modulation based on lowpass ﬁltering suited for high
	
	bandwidth efﬁciency. The lowpass ﬁlter is designed to give optimal
	performance while simultaniously fulﬁlling bandwidth requirements.
	In previous
	
	work, “optimal” meant maximal minimum Euclidean distance. In this
	thesis two other objective functions than distance are investigated,
	bit error
	
	rate and capacity. In both cases, the obtained systems are better
	than those
	
	optimized for Euclidean distance. The ﬁlter introduces ISI which has
	to be
	
	equalized by the receiver.
	
	FTN signaling is a technique that obtains bandwidth efﬁciency by transmitting
	consecutive information carrying symbols with less time separation
	
	than required for ISI-free transmission. Thus, with FTN signaling
	there is
	
	vno bandwidth reduction as with PRS, but rather a bit rate increase
	with constant bandwidth. Since the symbols appear too early, ISI
	cannot be avoided
	
	in the receiver. This thesis investigates the capacity limits of FTN
	signaling,
	
	designs concatenated coding schemes based on FTN, explores the behaviour
	
	of FTN on a MIMO channel, extends the state of the FTN art into a
	multicarrier setup and computes the minimum Euclidean distances for
	nonbinary
	
	FTN signaling.
	
	The ISI stemming from PRS and FTN signaling can be of signiﬁcant duration.
	Optimum detection is therefore normally ruled out, and reduced
	
	complexity detection strategies have to be looked into. This thesis
	investigates what the decision depth of an ISI detector should be
	and which timediscrete ISI model should be used when a reduced complexity
	receiver is
	
	deployed.},
